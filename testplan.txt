Test Plan:

 This test suite aims to cover the functionalities of the `Final.Cryptolib` and `Final.Secp256k1` modules.
 
 Automatically Tested:
 - Cryptographic hash functions (SHA-256, RIPEMD-160)
 - Base58Check encoding
 - Public key generation using Secp256k1
 
 Manually Tested:
 - Integration of modules in the main application
 - User interactions via the terminal interface
 
 Modules Tested by OUnit:
 - Final.Cryptolib: Testing SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hash functions, Base58Check encoding
 - Final.Secp256k1: Testing public key generation
 
 Test Case Development:
 - Black Box Testing: Tests were developed based on the expected behavior of the functions without internal knowledge of the code.
 - Glass Box Testing: Tests were also informed by the internal structure and logic of the code to cover edge cases.
 - Randomized Testing: Some tests (e.g., hash functions) use varied input strings, including special characters and Unicode.
  
 Argument for Correctness:
 - The test suite includes a variety of test cases that cover normal, edge, and error conditions for each function.
 - With over 50 tests, it ensures robustness and reliability of the cryptographic functions and key generation process.
 - By verifying outputs against known correct values, the test suite demonstrates the correctness of the system.
